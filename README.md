# PythonGeometryTools

Lightweight and simple methods for geometry comparison operations written using Python and ArcPy. Useful if you only want to compare a pair of points and don't want to mess with reading and writing to a geodatabase data table using ArcPy's native "Point Distance" tool. 

Requires ESRI ArcPy libraries to run, but can be modified to use a custom point object if necessary. Will throw compilation errors if ArcPy is not installed.

## Installation

First, ensure Pyhon 2.7+ is installed. Optional: install ArcGIS for ArcPy libraries. You may then checkout and run example class straight from IDLE, or customize and inherit into existing Python project.

## Usage

Classes are build for extensibility and incorporation into other projects as needed. Some coding or modification required to use.
